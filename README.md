# The Simons's game:

## game description:

The simon's game is a basic understandle game , the player needs to press start game , a colored button will flash , then the player has to press the button that flashed , when he proceeds to the next level , another button will flash , he will have to press the previous sequence button then finally the current level button , when the game is running the start game button will be inactive (doesnt reset the game for the player) , there wil be a small delay between the presses on the buttons , its implemented on purpose so the player doesnt press the buttons too quickly , there is a button on the top right corner that changes the light mode of the page from dark to light , the is also a top score indicator on top left side of th escreen which displays the highest score that has been scored on the device using localStorage, when the player misses the sequence he will lose and then he will need to press start game to start another run where his score will be reset , but the top score wont since its on localStorage . the reason i picked this game to work on is because i felt like it could be a good idea for the first project , nothing too complicated to work on and the game is already a well known game , also I really love that game .

## Getting started :

just press the link below to play the game

## tech side

basic js is used for dom manipulation of the page , css is used to style font on the page and colors and to make touching the buttons more interactive with a delay between the clicks to prevent player from rapid clicking , html is where the elements of the game were created , such as the buttons .

## the next steps

- [x] adding the localStorage to store the topScore for the player on the device.
- [x] implementing a light mode change button.
- [x] using the media query to scale the game for phones and smaller screens.
- [x] adding a toggle on the instructions to hide them and display them.
- [] making more difficulty options
